## Abstract

The proposal defines a set of standards for upgrading non-fungible tokens to AI agents and specifying their interaction mechanisms. These AI agents allow interaction with other contracts or external applications without making changes to the existing non-fungible tokens

## Motivation

Making the NFT on-chain interactive can lead to a lot of fun scenarios, not just as an Avatar. Because it is compatible with the ERC6551 protocol, AI Agent is also an Ethereum Account. At the same time, many scenarios can be extended by defining `abilityURI`, interaction processes, and interfaces in AI Agent Account. Here are some examples of scenarios:

- abilityURI links to a prompt: Users can chat with AI Agent or ask the AI Agent to help draw a picture and mint it into an NFT.
- abilityURI links to a langchain task: Users can ask the NFT to help with complex tasks.
- abilityURI links to an ML algorithm: Let AI Agent predict token prices or the weather

The AI Agent must also define its interaction interface, and based on business requirements, this interface can be implemented for payment, whitelist, or qualification interactions, according to permission controls.

## Overview

The system extends the definition of Account in ERC-6551, which mainly includes three points:

1. Add an `abilityURI` method, whose content may be an ipfs or s3 link, and the link content may be prompt or langchain code.
2. Define an interface for how other contracts or external accounts interact with the AI Agent.
3. Define an interface for receiving AI Agent results.

The following diagram shows how the protocol works:

## Specification

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY” and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

We define the smart contract interface below:

- **AgentRequested**: This event emits when the agent is requested, The off-chain AI Agent service needs to listen, perform the task, and return the result
- **AbilityURIUpdated**: This event emits when the abilityURL is updated.
- **abilityURI()**: Get the abilityURI for the AI Agent
- **setAbilityURI()**: Agent owner can update the abilityURI
- **requestAgent()**: Called by passing a bytes input and emit AgentRequested event. It can be customized by the owner, such as paid request.
- **handleAgentResponse()**:The result of the call is written through this method, and then an index is required to ensure the order of the result

```solidity
interface IERC7594 is IERC6551Account {
    /**
     * @notice This event emits when the agent is requested, The off-chain service needs to listen, perform the task, and return the result
     */
    event AgentRequested(uint256 index, bytes input);
    
    /**
     * @notice This event emits when the abilityURI is updated
     */ 
    event AbilityURIUpdated(string uri);

    /**
     * @notice Get the abilityURI for the AI Agent
     * @return The abilityURI
     */
    function abilityURI() external view returns(string memory);

    /**
     * @notice Update the abilityURI
     */
    function setAbilityURI(string memory uri) external;

    /**
     * @notice Request agent with input
     */
    function requestAgent(bytes memory input) payable external;

    /**
     * @notice Handle agent response with index
     */
    function handleAgentResponse(uint256 index, bytes response) external;
}
```

1. The smart contract implementing IERC7594 MUST implement IERC6551Account.
2. The AbilityURIUpdated event MUST be emitted when the abilityURI is updated.
3. The AgentRequested event MUST be emitted when the `requestAgent` function is requested. 


## Rationale

The key features of this proposal are: 1. Create a unified set of on-chain AI agent interaction interfaces and processes. 2. Upgrade AI agents without changing any properties of NFTs by being compatible with the ERC6551 protocol. 3. Project parties or developers can easily implement their own AI agents, which brings many interesting scenarios.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is backward compatible with [ERC-6551](./erc-6551.md)

## Test Cases

Tests are included in [`ERC7594Tester.ts`](../assets/eip-7594/test/ERC7594Tester.ts).

To run them in terminal, you can use the following commands:

```
cd ../assets/erc-7594
pnpm install
npx hardhat test
```

## Reference Implementation

See [`SimpleERC7594Agent.sol`](../assets/erc-7594/contracts/SimpleERC7594Agent.sol).

## Security Considerations

Since the AI Agent relies on an off-chain Agent service, the protocol does not provide any mechanism to guarantee the authenticity of the accessed services, and it depends on which service the Agent creator chooses. Therefore, in order to provide security, off-chain Agent service should choose a decentralized computing network to provide services
